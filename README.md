#  Structures and Data Intelligence

In this book, the basic concepts and practical issues about the structures and algorithms related to  machine learning will be introduced. We will try to fill in the gap between the basic knowledge about data structures and the advanced progress of modern machine learning and data minining. The book is especially written for the second year students in the computer science departments, who have completed the study of preliminary knowledge of data structures.  It is also a new trial to write down what we have learned and look into the black box of new technologies in this field, such as deep learning. We always believe that it is quite not enough to only understand how to use the API of the platforms such as tensorfolw and pytorch. It is worthy of digging much deeper to know how to build the playform effectively and efficiently, and how to  workout a new solution for next generation of Artificial Intelligence & Data Mining. 


The book will be built on-line, and we will hope it can be finished within 1 month.
